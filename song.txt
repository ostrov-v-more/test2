You will always be my baby
I will always think of you
Yeah

Touch me in the morning
And last thing at night
Keep my body warm baby
You know it feels right
Take a little higher
I'm faking it too
Just tell me what you're feeling
I'll feel it with you
We can only understand what we are shown
How was I supposed to know our love would grow?

Move a little closer
Show you're looking up
Heal me with me with your loving
I need you so much
I need you so much

Yeah

We can only understand what we are shown
How was I supposed to know our love would grow?
We can only understand what we are shown
How was I supposed to know our love would grow?

Touch me in the morning
And last thing at night
Keep my body warm baby
You know it feels right
Take a little higher
I'm faking it too
Just tell me what you're feeling
I'll feel it with you

You touch my mind in special places
My heart races with you
